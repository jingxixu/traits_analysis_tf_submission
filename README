 Special Note:
In our code, all "validation" are repsect to the original validation set in CharLearn dataset, a.k.a our test set. 
That is why our test & evaluation script is called the validate.py instead of test.py
For our validation, check train.py line 165-172 the commented code. We compute validation along with training every 500 iterations
on our real validation set and monitor the result. However, loading a 1000 video validation is slow for our training.
Consider that it will be extremly hard for us to overfit on the dataset, so we commented the validation and directly pick the final model as our validation (by assuming the final model has the best performance).
